To execute the released buggy interpreters, simply run the file without a suffix (e.g., pig1) on a Linux system (Ubuntu release $\geq$ 20.04). On a 64-bit Windows system, execute the file with the ```.exe``` suffix (e.g., pig1.exe). If you don't have access to machines with these systems, we strongly recommend installing a virtual machine with Ubuntu 20.04 to ensure compatibility with the released buggy interpreters.
